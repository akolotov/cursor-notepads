# Cursor.ai Notepads Usage Notes

This repository serves as a collection of notes and examples related to the usage of the **Notepads** feature in [Cursor.ai](https://www.cursor.com/). Each example focuses on how Notepads can be leveraged to enhance the software development process by organizing prompts, references, and outcomes effectively.

## Repository Structure

Each example is stored in a dedicated directory with the following files:
- `notepad.md`: Contains the content of the corresponding Notepad used in Cursor.ai.
- `README.md`: Includes notes about the specific Notepad's usage, the goals it helped achieve, and additional prompts or strategies employed.

While these Notepads are tailored to specific tasks and repositories, they can serve as references for developing similar workflows or approaches in other projects.

## Purpose of the Repository

The primary aim is to:
1. **Document**: Capture how Notepads are used in real-world scenarios to solve specific problems or improve coding workflows.
2. **Share Insights**: Provide insights into effective strategies and prompts for utilizing Notepads.
3. **Promote Adaptability**: Inspire users to refine and adapt these Notepads for their unique development needs.

## Additional Notes

The functionality of Cursor.ai's Notepads can potentially be simulated in other coding assistance tools, such as [Aider.Chat](https://aider.chat/), [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), or VSCode Copilot. This can be achieved by maintaining a separate file for each Notepad and including it in the tool's context. However, this is an untested idea and has not been explored in practice.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore Examples**: Review the directories to understand how Notepads are structured and used.
2. **Adapt Ideas**: Modify and refine the shared Notepads for your own projects.
3. **Contribute**: Share your insights or enhancements through pull requests.

## Feedback and Contributions

Feedback is welcome! If you have suggestions or additional use cases, feel free to open an issue or contribute via a pull request.
