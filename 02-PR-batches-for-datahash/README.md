## Notes

**The Composer mode:** agent

The dialog started with:

> Take a look at @PR-batches-for-datahash  and @arbitrum.md . Consider are listed to be updated in the notepad: @arbitrum_controller.ex and @api.ex . Take into consideration related modules @arbitrum_view.ex , @l1_batch.ex , @da_multi_purpose_record.ex , @batch_to_da_blob.ex and @api_router.ex .
> 
> Do you think that steps described in "Changes in the reader functionality" and "Changes in the controller" will be enough to implement "Proposed solution"?
> 
> Think step by step and provide your view on this. Don't implement any changes yet. 

The consequent prompts:

> Thanks for recommendation, let's omit them so far. Let's implement the step 1 from "Changes in the reader functionality"

After the previous prompt the step 1 in the notepad was updated to insert the new function name.

> Let's implement the step 2 from "Changes in the reader functionality"

After the previous prompt the step 2 in the notepad was updated to insert the new function name.

> Let's implement the step 3 from "Changes in the reader functionality"

> Let's implement the step 4 from "Changes in the reader functionality"

> Let's implement the step 5 from "Changes in the reader functionality"

> Let's implement the step 1 from "Changes in the controller"

> Let's implement the remaing steps 2, 3 and 4 from "Changes in the controller"
