The content of the notepad was prepared with help of Cursor chat in the "Ask" mode. The current functionality was discussed in the chat and from time to time it also requested for design documentation preparation with prompts like "May you formulate "Problem description" section for a GitHub issue I would like to raise?" or "Prepare high level description of the changes for the modules @celestia.ex and @anytrust.ex.".

----

As soon as the content of the notepad (the notepad name is `same-DA-blob-in-same-chunk`) was finalized, a new chat in the "Agent" mode has been started:

> Take a look at section "High Level Scope of Changes" in @same-DA-blob-in-same-chunk and apply changes described in "New DB query" to @settlement.ex and @settlement.ex

----

> Apply the changes described for the function `prepare_for_import` in the section "Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.DA.Anytrust" of "High Level Scope of Changes" @same-DA-blob-in-same-chunk to @anytrust.ex 
>
> No need to check for duplication for keyset since it is already covered in `check_if_new_keyset`.

----

> Update the comment correspondingly

----

> Assuming that `db_records` consists of elements which data keys matches with elements `candidate_records` explain why it will not be more efficient go through all element in `db_records` and if the corresponding element in `candidate_records` exists compare its timeout and delete if it is necessary?

> No, it is not correct. Take a look at the description of a new function `eliminate_conflict` in @same-DA-blob-in-same-chunk : keys from `candidate_records` are used to get the records from DB. So, in worst case size of `db_records` is equal of `candidate_records` size, in the best case `db_records` is empty.

----

> Adjust the implementation of `resolve_conflict` in 

----

> Make a clause for `resolve_conflict([], candidate_records)` 

----

> Apply the changes described for the function `prepare_for_import` in the section "Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.DA.Celestia" of "High Level Scope of Changes" @same-DA-blob-in-same-chunk to @celestia.ex 

----

> Update `prepare_for_import` of @common.ex as it is described in "High Level Scope of Changes" of @same-DA-blob-in-same-chunk 

----

> Do you think it will be more readable if the function is implemented without `if`?

----

> I don't understand how the second parameter - the map of data records is passed to `Anytrust.resolve_conflict` (or `Celestia.resolve_conflict`)

----

> Take a look how `db_record_to_map` is used in `rollup_block_to_map` to transform DB records to a form that then returned from `unconfirmed_rollup_blocks` and can be easily used further.
>
> Consider to implement the same transformation by using `db_record_to_map` in `Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.Utils.Db.Settlement.da_records_by_keys` to return `Explorer.Chain.Arbitrum.DaMultiPurposeRecord.to_import()` rather than `Explorer.Chain.Arbitrum.DaMultiPurposeRecord.t()`. For simplicity of transformation, the `data` field must be kept in JSON form - a map `String.t()` -> `any()` if it is not empty.

----

> Timeout expected in the DB record is a string. After getting it from `db_record`, it needs to be converted to `DateTime` to be used in `DateTime.compare`. Implement conversion in `resolve_conflict` of @anytrust.ex since timeout is only applicable for this DA type.

Finally, two GitHub commits ([1](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/pull/12095/commits/176c6fd3b72bbecb2668ad0726aa669f16051ee6), [2](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/pull/12095/commits/1551b7f505877b8ccf141241b41c8e06bc1e0e5c)) were done.
