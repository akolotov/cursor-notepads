## Notes

**Composer mode:** Normal

The dialog started with:

> Take a look at @reduce-fetchers and resume if it is achievable? Don't make any code change yet.

Then it asked "Would you like me to proceed with implementing the script?", and answer was "Yes"

Consequent prompts:

> Why is the branch name needed in `git checkout "origin/no-merge/reduce-fetchers" -- "$file"`?

> in @simplify-fetchers.sh make the branch name configurable through `$REDUCED_FETCHERS_BRANCH`, by default `origin/no-merge/reduce-fetchers`
